## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "EAS login failed"
**Solution:** Make sure you're using `tbone0189@gmail.com` for EAS (not @aol.com)

### "No builds found"
**Solution:** The script will offer to create new builds. Say "yes" and wait 15-30 minutes.

### "Privacy policy URL not loading"
**Solution:** The URL is only active while this sandbox session is running. If needed, you can host permanently on:
- Netlify Drop: https://app.netlify.com/drop (drag `privacy-policy-hosting` folder)
- Your website: Upload `privacy-policy-hosting/index.html` to rippedcityinc.com

### "Demo account doesn't exist"
**Solution:** You must create it manually in your app before submitting. Reviewers will reject without it.

### "Screenshot upload failed"
**Solution:** Screenshots are correct size. Try uploading one at a time or use Safari browser.

1. **Do iOS first** - Apple's review is faster (1-3 days vs 1-7 days)
2. **Test demo account** - Login before submitting to ensure it works
3. **Use Safari** - Apple's site works best with Safari browser
4. **Save as you go** - App Store Connect auto-saves, but click Save anyway
